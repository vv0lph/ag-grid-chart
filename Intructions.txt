I want to run a small hackathon focused on AG Grid and AG Charts visualization libraries, where all internal configurations, components, and library features are persisted, and user-configurable features are saved in a backend database, here’s a complete plan and example implementation. The hackathon will challenge participants to build a customizable dashboard, and I’ll provide a starter template to help you get started.

Hackathon Plan
Challenge: Build a Customizable Dashboard with AG Grid and AG Charts
Objective:

Develop a web application that integrates AG Grid and AG Charts, allowing users to configure and customize the grid and chart, with all states persisted in a simple backend database.

Requirements:

Configuration: Users can customize the grid (e.g., columns, sorting, filtering) and chart (e.g., type, series, axes).
Persistence: Save the grid and chart states in a backend database and restore them on reload.
Integration: Use AG Grid’s data to generate AG Charts visualizations.
Database: Use a lightweight backend (e.g., Node.js with JSON or SQLite).
Suggested Tools:

Frontend: AG Grid, AG Charts, and  plain JavaScript.
Backend: Node.js with Express and a simple database (e.g., JSON file or SQLite).
Resources: AG Grid Docs, AG Charts Docs.
Evaluation:

Functionality: Does it meet all requirements?
Usability: Is the interface intuitive?
Code Quality: Is it clean and maintainable?
Starter Template
Below is a basic implementation using React, AG Grid, AG Charts, and a Node.js backend to demonstrate the concept. This can serve as a starting point for your hackathon participants.

Backend (Node.js)
Here’s a simple backend to pair with the frontend. Save this as server.js and run it with node server.js after installing dependencies (npm install express).

How to Use
Setup:
Run the backend (node server.js) after installing Node.js and Express.
Open the HTML file in a browser (ensure CORS allows localhost:3000 or serve it via a local server).
Customize:
Filter the grid or change the chart type using the buttons.
Click "Save State" to persist changes.
Reload: Refresh the page to see the state restored.
This template demonstrates persisting grid filters and chart configurations, fulfilling your hackathon’s goals. Participants can expand it by adding more features like column resizing, custom renderers, or a more robust database (e.g., SQLite).
